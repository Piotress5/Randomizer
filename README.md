## General Information
Here comes the Randomizer, a hub for random generators. Idea of this application was going through my mind since some years, but it's finally there! Originally I planned to deploy it as 3 individual apps, however after some thinking I decided to combine them into one greater project.


## Technologies Used
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- JavaScript ES6


## Features
#### List of the ready features:
- Main page allows you to choose between 3 applications: Wheel of Fortune, RNG and Opener,
- Wheel of Fortune is an editable form of classic wheel game allowing to write up to 100 possibilities by yourself,
- RNG is simple app to generate numbers, texts or to decide with Yes or No,
- Opener is an application, with which you can upload up to 30 images to randomize between them,
- Entire website uses sounds and transitions/animations, which can be turned on/off with settings, reachable at top right of page.

#### Additional info:
- Wheel of Fortune has an feature to paste list of options, so it's easier to pass in multiple entries. Moreover, it has editable colors.
- Opener has 3 ways of adding images: with classic sending through button at the bottom of page, dragging over zone with images and with pasting.
- There is 1 hidden Easter Egg.


## Setup
To run application, visit [_this_](https://piotress5.github.io/randomizer/) website or download all files and execute index.html in your browser (make sure to include all required files within one catalog).


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_.


## Room for Improvement
I'm planning to add some small features such as probabilities and "rarities" for opener, but they have less priority for me now.

Room for improvement:
- There is a visual bug in Chromium-based browsers, when scrolling through parallax panels first time, it stutters and lags a bit. It is engine's related problem.
- Mozilla has disabled feature of dragging images.

To do:
- Probabilities of options for Wheel and Opener,
- Rarity system for Opener.
